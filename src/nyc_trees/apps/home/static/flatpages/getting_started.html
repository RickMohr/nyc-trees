  <h3>1. Orientation</h3>

  <p>NYC Parks uses a street tree mapping method developed by TreeKIT, a non-profit organization based in NYC that helps city dwellers measure, map, and collaboratively manage urban forests. You will use the TreeKIT method to accurately map the location of street trees and, in the process, collect some data about each tree and its immediate environment.</p>

  <p>Your training will take place online and in the field. This online training program will teach you all of the basic skills and knowledge you need to expertly map trees on NYCâ€™s streets. At the end of this brief training, you will have a chance to RSVP for a field training event with NYC Parks or a partnering organization. When you finish your field training, you will be able to register for mapping events all across the city. You may also request special permission to map trees on your own time with help from a friend.</p>

  <p>NYC Parks will use the data you collect to create a citywide map of street trees. This interactive map will be available online for everyone to explore. Volunteer street tree stewards will use the map to track their work and keep in touch with each other online. We hope you will join them; after all, you will have played an important role in putting all those trees on the map!</p>

  <h3>2. The Data Collection Tools</h3>

  <p>The toolkit provided by NYC Parks contains a <strong>measuring</strong> wheel, a <strong>tape measure</strong>, and a <strong>tree identification guide</strong>. You will use the measuring wheel to measure the distance between trees on a block and a tape measure to measure the circumference of every tree and the diameter of every tree stump. The tree ID guide will help you determine the species of each tree you map.</p>

  <p>The <strong>measuring wheel</strong> measures distances in feet and tenths of a foot. A small odometer is attached to the wheel. A small black button resets the numbers on the odometer to zero.</p>

  <p>The <strong>tape measure</strong> is just like any ruler or a yardstick you have ever used. It measures in feet and inches.</p>

  <p>The <strong>tree ID guide</strong> will help you identify the species of most of the trees growing on the streets of NYC. The guide contains colorful photos of tree leaves and helpful hints for figuring out the species of each tree you map.</p>

  <p>Your <strong>eyesight</strong> is the last tool in your data collection toolkit. You will observe and record a list of different conditions related to each tree and its immediate surroundings, all of them based on simply looking at what is going on and recording what you see.</p>

  <h3>3. The Data Logging Tools</h3>

  <b>NEED IMAGE HERE</b>

  <p>You will use the TreesCount! <Em>Treecorder</Em>, a simple mobile website, to record data about the location and the condition of street trees and their immediate surroundings. The <Em>Treecorder</Em> will navigate to a map of the neighborhood where you are mapping trees. Follow the on-screen instructions to begin mapping. You may choose to collect data on a paper worksheet if your phone battery dies or you experience any other technical trouble in the field.</p>
