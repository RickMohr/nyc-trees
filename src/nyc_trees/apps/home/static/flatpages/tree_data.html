  <h3>1. Tree Structure</h3>
  <p>Street trees have one of three general structures: alive, dead, or cut down to a stump.</p>

  <ol>
      <li><p>A <strong>live</strong> tree has living leaves or needles during the late spring, summer, and early autumn. Even a tree with very few living leaves or needles is still alive this season. Record any tree with living leaves or needles as alive.</p></li>

<strong>NEED IMAGE HERE</strong>

      <li><p>A <strong>dead</strong> tree has no living leaves or needles. Record any tree with no living leaves or needles as dead.</p></li>

 <img src="/static/img/training/dead/dead.png"/>

      <li><p>A <strong>stump</strong> is the short length of trunk and underground roots left behind after a dead tree is cut down. Record any tree cut down to two feet or less in height as a stump. A stump should be no higher than your knee, more or less.</p></li>

  </ol>
  <p><em>Why track tree structure?</em></p>
  <p>Dead trees and stumps need to be removed to make space for new trees in the future.</p>
</div>

    <h3>2. Tree Trunk Size</h3>

    <p>Trunk size is measured in circumference, or the girth of the tree. The circumference is always measured at a point on the trunk that is 4.5 feet, or 54 inches, from the ground.</p>

    <p>Find a spot on the front of your body that is 4.5 feet from the ground. Use your tape measure to find that spot, measuring from the sole of your shoe upward. Use a sticker or pin to mark the same spot on your clothing every time you map trees.</p>

    <p>Approach the tree trunk. Use the spot on your body that is 4.5 feet from the ground to estimate the same height on the tree trunk. Wrap your tape measure around the trunk 4.5 feet from the ground. Estimate to the nearest inch on the tape measure. Record the circumference in the <em>Treecorder.</em></p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/circ-standard/circ-standard.png"/>

    <ol>
        <li>What if the tree trunk bumps out at 4.5 feet from the ground? Simple. Just move your tape measure up to the nearest point where the bump out ends and the trunk resumes a more or less uniform shape.</li>

    <img src="/static/img/training/circ-branching/circ-branching.png"/>

        <li>What if the tree has two or more significant trunks branching apart 4.5 feet from the ground? Move your tape measure to the nearest point below the point where the trunk branches out.</li>

    <img src="/static/img/training/circ-bumpout/circ-bumpout.png"/>

    </ol>

    <p><em>Why measure tree trunk size?</em></p>

    <p>Tree trunk size tells us about the amount of carbon dioxide a tree soaks up from the atmosphere, the amount of electricity it conserves by shading and cooling the local environment, and the amount of water it soaks up during a rainstorm.</p>
</div>

<div id="tree-stump-size">
    <h3>3. Tree Stump Size</h3>
    <p>Tree stump size is measured in diameter, or the width across the top of the stump. Make a quick visual guestimate of the widest distance across the top of a stump at the outside edge of the bark. Use your tape measure across that distance. Enter the diameter into the <em>Treecorder.</em></p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/Stump/stump.png"/>

    <p><em>Why measure tree stump size?</em></p>
    <p>NYC Parks uses estimates of tree stump size to plan for stump removal efforts across the city.</p>

<div>
    <h3>4. Tree Species</h3>

    <p>Scientists have worked over centuries to categorize all of the different plants found on earth, grouping different kinds of plants together by the different physical features they have in common. You will look for the same set of physical features to identify and name all of the trees you find on the streets of New York.</p>

    <p>Every street tree in NYC has two names: the first name is a “common name” that may vary from country to country or even state to state. For example, the tree known as <em>Little Leaf Linden</em> in NYC is known as a <em>Lime Tree</em> in the South and a <em>Tilia</em> in many European countries.</p>

    <p>The second name is a scientific “Latin name” that is the same all over the world, no matter
        what language is spoken. The Latin name has two parts: the first part is the <em>Genus</em>, or a general category of trees that share a lot of traits. The second part is the <em>species</em>, or the specific name of each individual tree. It’s just like your first name and your family name, but in reverse! So, for example, the American Linden tree has the Latin name <em>Tilia americana</em>, <em>Tilia</em> being the name of a larger group of similar trees and <em>americana</em> being the specific name of the particular type of <em>Tilia</em> that is native to North America and has big, bright, green leaves.</p>

    <p>NYC Parks will give you a copy of a Trees Count! 2015 tree ID guide, a comprehensive visual key to approximately 140 different kinds of street trees in the five boroughs. The guide mainly uses the physical features of tree leaves, with a few other helpful hints, to help you figure out each kind of tree you’re looking at out in the field. The guide folds out like an old-fashioned street map, and you should feel free to re-fold the paper in any way that helps you compare different kinds of leaves.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step One: Identify the Leaf Shape and Edge</h4>
            <p>The shape of every NYC street tree leaf falls into one of eleven basic categories. Some leaves are shaped like a spade. Others are shaped like a teardrop. Some are shaped like a feathery fan. Others are shaped like a football. Some trees have needles instead of leaves. Each of these categories contains leaves with different kinds of edges: some are wavy, some are smooth, and some are jagged like the edge of a bread knife. Compare a leaf from each tree you find on the street to each of the leaf shape and edge categories on the guide.</p>

            <p>Note: some leaves can be tricky and look like they belong in more than one category. Remember, when in doubt, look at more than one leaf from the same category to try and figure it out.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Step Two: Consider Tree Frequency</h4>
            <p>Some tree species are found in big numbers on streets throughout NYC. There are
                almost 95,000 London Plane trees scattered throughout the five boroughs, nearly
                45,000 Pin Oak trees, and more than 20,000 Green Ash trees. Compare that to the less
                than twenty Scots Pine trees or the fewer than five Black Maples planted along the city’s
                sidewalks. If you’re holding a leaf that looks like it belongs to a London Plane Tree but
                you’re confused because it also looks kind of like it might belong to a Black Maple, just
                trust the numbers; it’s probably a London Plane tree. Each leaf in your tree ID guide will
                have some green dots below it: one dot means the tree is
                planted in low numbers (under 99 across all of NYC); two
                dots means the tree is planted in moderate numbers
                (between 100 and 999), three dots mean the tree is planted
                in high numbers (between 1,000 and 9,999), and four dots
                mean the tree is very frequently planted (more than 10,000).
                The top 24 most common street trees are also printed on the
                front and back of the guide. Look for a pink star next to the
                name of the top 24 most common street trees everywhere
                they appear in the guide.

        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 3: Consider Leaf Arrangement</h4>
            <p>Most tree leaves are arranged in one of two patterns on a branch: <strong>opposite</strong>, where each leaf has a mirror twin growing directly across from it on the branch; and <strong>alternate</strong>, where leaves zigzag down the length of a branch. Most NYC street trees have alternate leaf arrangements. Each tree with <strong>opposite</strong> leaf patterns will have a small icon in the tree ID guide. You can assume that all other trees have alternate leaf patterns.
<img src="/static/img/training/opposite/opposite.png"/></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Step 4: Consider Other Context Clues</h4>
            <p>Leaves are the first and most important physical
                feature used for identifying a tree species, but when
                the leaf isn’t enough, you can turn to the tree bark,
                seeds, flowers, fruits, and other defining features for
                help. Your tree ID guide will include helpful tips for
                deciding whether the leaf you’re holding in your
                hand matches the leaf on the paper.

</p>

            <p>Find the name of each tree you map in the tree ID guide. Begin to type the name of the
                tree into the <em>Treecorder</em> and the system will begin to show some options based on what you type. Select your tree from the options that appear.</p>
</li>

        <li>
            <h4 id="what-if-im-not-sure">What if I’m Not Sure?</h4>
            <p>Identifying a tree species can be challenging at first. Don’t worry; you will get the hang
                of it quickly. Before long you will be able to impress all of your friends by naming the
                species of each tree on your block. Yet a tricky tree can sometimes stump even the
                most skilled foresters. If you find yourself spending too much time trying to figure it out,
                just make your best guess. You can rank your confidence in the <em>Treecorder</em> for each tree you identify: “Yes” if you’re very confident; “Maybe” if you’re moderately confident; “No” if you are in doubt of your choice.</p>

    <h3>5. Perceptions of Tree Health</h3>

    <p>The health of a living street tree is rated <strong>good</strong>, <strong>fair</strong>, or <strong>poor</strong>, depending on five factors: 1) the density of leaves in the tree canopy; 2) the overall color of the leaves; 3) the presence or absence of broken branches; 4) the presence or absence of trunk wounds; and 5) the shape of the tree after repeated pruning or branch loss.</p>

    <!-- this is in a box-->
    <p>A tree that is in <strong>good</strong> health may have a dense canopy of leaves or needles with few, if any, bald
        spots. Few of the tree leaves or needles have brown spots, holes, or other kinds of damage. Most
        leaves are consistently the same color. Few or none of the smaller branches may be broken. None of
        the larger branches are broken. There is little or no damage to the trunk and its bark.

    <!-- this is in a box-->
    <p>A tree that is in <strong>fair</strong> health may have a canopy of leaves or needles with one or more obvious bald
        spots. Many of the tree leaves or needles may show brown spots, holes, or other kinds of damage.
        Many leaves show changes in color from the average. Some small branches may be broken. None of
        the larger branches are broken. There may be some damage to the trunk and its bark.

<img src="/static/img/training/Fair-Health-Four/fair-health-four.png"/>
</p>

    <!-- this is in a box-->
    <p>A tree that is in <strong>poor</strong> health may be missing many or most of its leaves. Any remaining leaves may
        show significant brown spots, holes, or other kinds of damage. Most leaves have changed color from
        the average. Small and large branches may be broken. There may be significant damage to the trunk
        and its bark.

<img src="/static/img/training/Poor-health-two/poor-health-two.png"/>
<img src="/static/img/training/Poor-health-three/poor-health-three.png"/>

</p>

    <p>Look at the whole tree. Observe the condition of the canopy of leaves, the branches, and the
        trunk. Take no more than 30 seconds to decide if the tree is in good, fair, or poor health.
        Record your observation in the <em>Treecorder</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Why Measure Perceptions of Tree Health?</em></p>
    <p>Tracking perceptions of tree health may help NYC Parks understand where there are trees that
        need extra help to survive.</p>
