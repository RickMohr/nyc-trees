    <h3>The Overall Mapping Method</h3>

    <p>NYC Parks uses the TreeKIT method instead of modern GPS because it is affordable, easy-to-learn, and more reliable than GPS in many cases. This mapping method involves measuring the location of trees along the edge of a single block, going from one intersection to another, one side of the street at a time. We call these chunks of the sidewalk “block edges.” You may find it helpful to think of a block edge lined with street trees as a necklace strung with big green “beads” or a subway line with leafy green “stops” along the route.</p>

  <p>The TreeKIT method measures the distances between street trees as you walk from one intersection to another on one side of the street. A computer transforms those distance measurements into a map on the Internet. The method is based on very old and very reliable site surveying techniques; some of the same techniques that were used to plot out the Manhattan street grid more than two hundred years ago.</p>

    <h3>Getting Started In the Field</h3>

    <p>You have:
        <ul>
            <li>A kit that contains a measuring wheel, a tape measure, and a tree ID guide</li>
            <li>A set of block edges to map</li>
            <li>Travelled to your first block edge out in the field</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>You are ready to map the trees on your first block edge!</p>

    <p>Log into the <em>Treecorder</em> on your phone or tablet and find your first block edge on the system map. Use the target to highlight your first block edge as a red line. Two blue circles will appear at each end of the block edge where it intersects with other streets. Click on the circle at the intersection where you will begin mapping. It will highlight in red along with the block edge once it has been selected.</p>

    <p>A block edge begins at one street intersection and ends at another street intersection; in other words, block edges begin and end at street corners. Most intersecting block edges come together at a gentle curve or rounded edge. Find your starting point for mapping by estimating the spot where two block edges would intersect if their connecting corner were not curved. A “guesstimate” will suffice.</p>
    <p>Most intersections, especially those in Manhattan, will have right angles like this one.</p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/right/right.png"/>

    <p>Intersections with wide angles will have start points that are closer to the connecting curve.</p>

    <img src="/static/img/training/Oblique/oblique.png"/>

    <p>Intersections with narrow angles will have start points that are farther from the connecting curve.</p>

    <p>Stand at your intersecting start point. Be careful to avoid oncoming traffic and other pedestrians. Remember, safety first!</p>

    <p>Take a moment to consider the direction you are heading as you map from the starting intersection to the ending intersection. Based on the direction you are heading, are the street trees to the <strong>LEFT</strong> of the sidewalk curb or to the <strong>RIGHT</strong> of the sidewalk curb?</p>

    <p>Record <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong> on your phone or tablet.</p>

    <h3>Mapping From The Start Point to the First Tree</h3>

    <p>Reset the odometer on your measuring wheel to zero.</p>

    <p>Touch the edge of the wheel to your intersecting start point and walk toward the first tree on your block edge. Keep the wheel on the edge of the sidewalk curb to help make your measurements as accurate as possible.</p>

    <p>Keep walking and rolling until the wheel is centered on the middle of the first tree trunk on the block edge. Carefully note the precise spot where you stopped rolling. You may find it useful to mark the spot with a coin, nearby stick, or stone. Lift the wheel and read the distance on the odometer. Enter the distance number in the <em>Treecorder</em>.</p>

    <p>Continue to map the location of every tree on the block edge after logging some basic information about the first tree and its immediate surroundings (more on this later).</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Mapping Distance Between Trees</h3>

    <p>Reset the odometer on the wheel to zero. Touch the wheel back down on the exact spot where you stopped rolling for the previous measurement. Walk along the curb edge and roll the wheel until you arrive at the approximate center of the next tree trunk on the block. Repeat the process for the distance between every tree on the block.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Mapping to the End Point</h3>

    <p>Find the end point at the ending intersection using the same method you used to find the start point at the starting intersection. Walk and roll the measuring wheel from the center of the last tree trunk on the block edge to the end point. Lift the wheel and record the distance number in the Treecorder.</p>
</div>


<div>
    <h1>Mapping Trees Away From The Curb</h1>

    <p>Some street trees are not planted near the sidewalk curb. That is OK! If the next tree you see is offset from the curb, just keep rolling the wheel along the curb until you arrive at the approximate center of the offset tree trunk. Log the tree as “Offset From The Curb” on your phone or tablet. The system will map the tree away from the curb later on. Just remember to keep going along the curb and logging each offset tree as you find them.</p>

    <p>What if two trees are directly parallel to each other: one on the curb and one offset from the curb? Map and record data for the tree nearest to the curb first. When you are done logging data for the curbside tree, enter a distance of zero for the tree that is directly parallel and offset from the curb. When you are done logging data for the offset tree, return your measuring wheel to the point where you stopped on the nearby curbside tree. Roll to the next tree and record that distance, just as if there hadn’t been an offset tree.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>What If There Aren’t Any Trees?</h1>

    <p>Some streets don’t have street trees. That is OK! We need to record the block edges without street trees, too. After selecting your block edge, start point, and the side of the street you are mapping, you can click the “No Trees” button in the Treecorder, and that’s it! The block edge has been recorded as having no trees.</p>
