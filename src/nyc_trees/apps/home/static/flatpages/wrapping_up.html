    <h3>Submitting Data</h3>
    <p>Click “Submit” at the bottom of the Treecorder to submit all of the data you collected for a block edge. The Treecorder will quickly make a map with all of your data and show it back to you on your phone or tablet. Look closely: does the map look accurate?</p>
    <p>If your map looks inaccurate you can click “No - Start Over” to map the block edge again OR “No - Submit for Review” if you think you mapped everything accurately but something just doesn’t look right and you want NYC Parks to take another look.</p>
    <p>If your map looks accurate, click “Yes!” to officially record your data.</p>
