NYC Parks Trees Count! 2015 tree census

## Local Development

A combination of Vagrant 1.5+ and Ansible 1.6+ is used to setup the development environment for this project. It of the following virtual machines:

- `app`
- `tiler`
- `services`

The `app` virtual machine contains an instance of the Django application, `tiler` contains a tiling server, and `services` contains shared resources of `app` and `tiler`:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Logstash
- Kibana
- Graphite
- Statsite

Use the following command to bring up a local development environment:

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

After provisioning is complete, you can login to the application server to execute Django management commands:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh app
vagrant@app:~$ envdir /etc/nyc-trees.d/env /opt/app/manage.py test
```

**Note**: If you get an error that resembles the following, try logging into the `app` virtual machine again for the group permissions changes to take effect:

```
envdir: fatal: unable to switch to directory /etc/nyc-trees.d/env: access denied
```

### Ports

The Vagrant configuration maps the following host ports to services
running in the VMs. You can change the host port numbers by setting
the environment variables listed in the ``Env Variable Override``
column.

Service                | Port  | URL                                              | Env Variable Override
---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------
Django Web Application | 8000  | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)   | (no variable)
Graphite Dashboard     | 8080  | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)   | NYC_TREES_PORT_8080
Kibana Dashboard       | 5601  | [http://localhost:15601](http://localhost:15601) | NYC_TREES_PORT_5601
pgweb                  | 15433 | [http://localhost:15433](http://localhost:15433) | NYC_TREES_PORT_5433
Redis                  | 16379 | `redis-cli -h localhost 16379`                   | NYC_TREES_PORT_6379


### Javascript and CSS

The main tool used is [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), which is exposed through `npm run` to avoid version conflicts.

 - To create JS bundles, compile sass, and concatenate third-party css, minify CSS and JS, and version files using `gulp-rev-all`, use `gulp` or `npm run build`.
 - To do the above but skip minification and versioning, use `gulp build --debug` or `npm run build-debug`.
 - To watch files and automatically rebuild the JS or sass files when they change, use `gulp watch --debug` or `npm run watch`.  This will also start a [livereload server](http://livereload.com/).

`gulp build` and `gulp watch` without the `--debug` flag are intentionally not exposed through `npm run`.

#### Linting

`./scripts/npm.sh run lint`

### Caching

In order to speed up things up, you may want to consider using a local caching proxy. The `VAGRANT_PROXYCONF_ENDPOINT` environmental variable provides a way to supply a caching proxy endpoint for the virtual machines to use:

```bash
$ VAGRANT_PROXYCONF_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.96.10:8123/" vagrant up
```

### Log Aggregation

In order to view the Kibana web UI, navigate to the following URL from a browser on the virtual machine host:

```
http://localhost:5601/
```

### Statistics Aggregation

In order to view the Graphite Web UI, navigate to the following URL from a browser on the virtual machine host:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Deployment

Deployment is driven by the [Amazon Web Services CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/), but expects the following resources to exist in the target AWS account:

- An EC2 key pair
- Access keys to sign API requests
- An IAM role for the application and tile servers
- An SNS topic for global notifications

In order to get started, install the deployment dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r deployment/requirements.txt
```

Then, generate all of the CloudFormation templates:

```bash
$ cd deployment
$ make
```

### Launch the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

From within the `deployment` directory, create the VPC CloudFormation stack:

```
$ make vpc-stack
```

### Launch the Data Store Servers

When the VPC stack is complete, create the data store CloudFormation stack:

```
$ make data-store-stack
```

### Create Private DNS stack

After the data store stack is complete, create the private DNS stack:

```
$ make private-dns-stack
```

### Create Monitoring Server AMI

Now that both the VPC, data store, and private DNS stacks are complete, we can generate the monitoring server AMI. This needs to occur *after* the data store stack is complete because Redis (part of the data store stack) is used as a buffer for inbound messages into Logstash:

```
$ make monitoring-ami
```

After the monitoring server AMI is created, we need to update the VPC and private DNS stacks so that the bastion host uses the new monitoring server AMI. The bastion host has dual roles (VPC bastion and monitoring server):

```
$ make update-vpc-stack
$ make update-private-dns-stack
```

### Launch the Tile and Application Servers

Now that the VPC, data store, and monitoring stacks are setup, we can begin working on the tile and applications servers. First, we need to create their AMIs:

```
$ make app-and-tiler-amis
```

Next, we can create each server stack, which will make use of the most recent AMIs available:

```
$ make tiler-stack
$ make app-stack
```
